# discord-game

## Aims

I aim to create a discord chat bot that allows users to collect randomly generated creatures and then battle one another with them.

## Structure

The Bot is written in Java 13 currently and makes use of the [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA) package for discord integration. The bot will store data in a MySQL database.
